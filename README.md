## Description

For many users, especially ones working at the computer for long periods of time, it is necessary to remember large amounts of information and new tasks. The Note Taker provides a way for these users to write notes, give these notes a title, and save them to the application. Users can access any note they have previously written by clicking on the note in the sidebar, and they can delete notes if they no longer need them. The application uses JavaScript, Node.js, the node packages Express and Nodemon, Bootstrap CSS, and FontAwesome Icons to create efficient note taking technology readily available to users.

## Usage

You can view this application at https://mw-note-taker-app.herokuapp.com/. 

When you open the application to the index page, click the button that reads "Get Started" in order to be brought to the note-taking page. Once there, you can type in your notes. When you are done typing in your note, you can click the "save" icon to save your note to the program. You can save as many notes as you would like. If you want to delete a note, you can click on the trash can icon next to the note and it will be deleted.
